# Machine Learning Project - KICKSTARTER DATASET

#### 1. Preprocessing - EDA (Exploratory data analysis)

       a. General view of the data, what is in it (research)
           - Quantiles and outliers,
           - Shapes,
           - Missing values,
           - Data errors (duplicate records)
       b. Data cleaning
           - Data normalization and standardization
           - Removal of outliers
       c. Dividing the dataset into training + validation + test (cross validation + decision method)
    
#### 2. Model selection

    a. Linear regression
    b. Logistic regression
    c. KNN vs. K-means
    d. Decision tree
    e. Random forest
    f. SVN
    g. Bayes
    h. Xgboost
    
#### 3. Features selection

    a. Which variables are important
    b. What parameters should be taken into final model
    c. Use of parameters that will enable the selection and comparison of models (MSE etc.)
    
#### 4. Final model and performance on test dataset
